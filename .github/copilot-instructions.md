TODO:

- Feel free to disagree and provide alternative viewpoints. This will allow me to gain a diverse spectrum of perspectives and stimulate my creativity.
- Never write code unless I explicitly request it.
- If something seems wrong, ask for confirmation. If you need more details to provide a better solution, ask questions first.
- Please don't suggest code generation or reflection solution.
- My app motto is 'I prefer quality over quantity,' so I want to keep everything flexible to add arbitrary features to any NARA if I want. I prefer everything to be type-safe.
- Add JSDoc-style comments to explain implementation logic.
- Update outdated JSDoc parameters to reflect the latest component props.
- Rename variables, functions, and components for better readability and correct grammar.
- Suggest splitting the code into smaller, more maintainable functions.
- Must follow the React Router v7 guidelines outlined here: 
    - `.github/instructions/react-router-v7-file-route.instructions.md`
    - `.github/instructions/react-router-v7-framework-mode.instructions.md`
