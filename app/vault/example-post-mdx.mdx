# Welcome to Your Blog

This is an example blog post written in **MDX** format. MDX allows you to use React components directly in your markdown content!

## Features

- ✅ Full React component support
- 📝 Markdown syntax
- 🎨 Custom styling
- 🔥 Hot reload in development

## What You Can Do

You can write regular markdown:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- _Italic text_
- `Code snippets`

### Code Blocks

```typescript
export function example() {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

### Next Steps

1. Create your own `.mdx` files in the `/app/vault` folder
2. Add frontmatter with title, description, date, etc.
3. Write your content using markdown and React components
4. Your posts will be automatically available in the blog
