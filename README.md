## üìò Overview

A fast, opinionated starter for building **full-stack React apps** with **modern tooling** and **Cloudflare Workers deployment**. Designed with focus on **type safety**, **performance**, and **developer ergonomics**.

üìñ See [Project Overview](docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for more on project structure.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Method 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)

Create a new project with automatic setup:

```bash
npx degit KotonoSora/nara-vite-react-boilerplate#main my-new-project
cd my-new-project
node setup.mjs
```

The setup script will:
- Configure your `package.json` with project details
- Create a project-specific `README.md`
- Prompt for project name, description, and other details

### Method 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer manual configuration:

```bash
npx degit KotonoSora/nara-vite-react-boilerplate#main my-new-project
cd my-new-project
cp package.template.json package.json
cp README.template.md README.md
# Edit package.json and README.md manually
```

### After Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your settings
   ```

3. **Set up database:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

4. **Start development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
