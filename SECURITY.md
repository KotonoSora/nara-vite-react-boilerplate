## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs in NARA seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/KotonoSora/nara-vite-react-boilerplate/security/advisories/new) feature.

Our team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, our team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Generally, the full process will look something like this when we receive a new advisory via Github:

- If the advisory is valid, we'll move it into `Draft` status as we begin our investigation
- We'll inform common hosting platforms of the vulnerability so they can make any preventative changes on their end even before the vulnerability is fixed/published
  - If you are a hosting provider and you want to be notified right away, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/KotonoSora/nara-vite-react-boilerplate/issues/new) and label it with `security-vulnerability` and we'll get you added
- We'll publish a new version of NARA with a fix
- We'll update our own sites with the new version
- After a period of time, potentially up to a month or so, we'll publish the advisory
  - This gives application developers time to update their applications to the latest version before we make the details of the advisory public
