# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors, maintainers, and users of the NARA project, we are committed to creating a welcoming and respectful community for everyone.

We expect everyone participating in the development, discussion, or support of this project to use a friendly, constructive tone at all times â€” regardless of the topic or conversation partner.

We do **not tolerate discrimination or harassment** based on (but not limited to) gender, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or personal background.

We welcome healthy discussions and objective feedback. Everyone should feel safe giving and receiving constructive criticism with professionalism and respect.

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/KotonoSora/nara-vite-react-boilerplate/issues/new) and label it with `coc-violation`.

We thank all contributors for helping create a positive and inclusive space for collaboration.
